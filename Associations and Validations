example of associations gone right!

belongs_to :Parent_ID
  - Denotes that the class has ONE parent, as opposed to one to many relationships

has_many :thingsthattheyhave_ID
  - Been using this one a lot

has_many :x, through: :x.y
  - Often used to set up a many to many connection with another model. 
  the association indicates that the decalring model can be matched with 
  zero or more instances of another model by proceeding through a third model. 
  For example, consider a medical practice where the patients made appointments 
  to see physicians. the relevant association delcarations could look like this:

  class Physicians < applicationRecord
    has_many :appointments
    has_many :paitents, through: :appointments
  end

  class Appointment < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :patient
    belongs_to :physician
  end

  class Partient < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :appointments
    has_many :physicians, through: :appointments
  end

has_many :x, through: :x.y, :source :z
  - Used when you want to specify an association that isnt quite 
  listed, almost like defining a new namespace
